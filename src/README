Sky - creates the sky

Night - Creates the Night

Sun - Creates the sun

SunHalo - Creates the sun halo

The four classes were built according to the instructions of the exercise

===========================================
= Trees package classes + Design Patterns =
===========================================

We chose to use the principle of encapsulation and create separate departments with their own responsibilities.

Flora class: responsible for generating a forest of trees randomly. Following the API requirements, we chose to
             create an object of the class and use its function of creating trees in the range.

Fruit class: responsible for creating a single fruit. It inherits from a game object to use its abilities.

Leaf class: responsible for creating a single leaf. It inherits from a game object to use its abilities.

Tree trunk class: responsible for creating a tree trunk. Inherits from the block class in order to use the block's
                  ability and thus let the avatar stand on the tree trunk and also make sure that a collision will
                  occur and the avatar will stop in place.

Tree class: responsible for creating a complete tree with the help of the previous classes.

TreeInfo class: an auxiliary department that collects the information of the tree that we added in order
                to optimize the method of returning the tree to the method that creates trees in Flora

In addition to encapsulation, we also used the principle of inclusion in the tree information auxiliary class,
where each object of the class contains objects of other classes.

It is important to note that we chose to send Flora a reference to the function that calculates the height of
the land in x because we thought it was a wiser design choice in light of the weeks on which the exercise is based.

We will also note that our classes use transitions as we will learn in the other parts of the exercise.

=   Other Design Patterns   =
=============================

As written in the instructions, the sky, night, sun and sun halo classes are separate classes and have a static
function in order to produce a new object. Transitions are also used there.
